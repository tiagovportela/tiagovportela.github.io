Greetings! I'm Tiago, a seasoned Data Analytics Engineer with a diverse background in crafting analytical solutions and developing innovative systems. Over the past years, my professional journey has been marked by a relentless pursuit of excellence and a passion for data-driven insights.

## Professional Journey

My journey in data began with a role as a Motion Analysis Engineer at Nelo, where I delved into creating algorithms and employing statistical and data science techniques to describe 3D motion in elite kayak paddlers. 

Currently, at Critical Manufacturing, I wear the hat of a Data Analytics Engineer, working with tools like Microsoft Reporting Service and SQL, while also contributing as an IoT Engineer with a focus on semiconductors industry

## Education

I pursued my academic journey at the Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto, earning a Master's degree in Integrated Electrical and Computer Engineering(Incompleted). Complementing this, I obtained a Postgraduate Degree in Data Science from Atl√¢ntica.

## Beyond Data

While my professional expertise lies in data analytics and technology, my interests extend beyond the digital realm. I'm an avid enthusiast of politics, history, and philosophy, finding joy in engaging conversations that stimulate intellectual curiosity. Outside of the data-driven world, I transform into an amateur astronomer, seeking solace in the quiet beauty of the night sky.

## Philosophy

Fuelled by curiosity, I approach challenges with a blend of analytical rigor and creative problem-solving. My goal is not only to solve problems but to architect solutions that make a meaningful impact.

## Let's Connect

I'm always eager to connect with individuals who share a passion for data, technology, and the broader spectrum of knowledge. Whether you're interested in discussing the latest data trends or delving into philosophical debates, I welcome the opportunity to connect. Explore my [portfolio](https://tiagovportela.github.io/), and let's embark on a journey of innovation and discovery together.

Cheers,  
Tiago
